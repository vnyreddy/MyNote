# MyNote
MyNote will be the quickest note-taking application within the reach of your fingertip with the minimal interaction. 

You have experienced all note-taking applications which have to follow few unnecessary steps to make a quick note, those steps involve opening application (which take few click of time), then click on the new note (generally a + icon) which opens new interface, then have to name the note and save. All most all the note applications are following the same old style. 

On the other hand, MyNote, a new era of quick note-taking application. It involves only a couple of steps to make a new note. As soon as you open the MyNote app, it will open a new note-taking interface(text input) with the last copied text from the clipboard in the input text field (of course you can edit), also along with previously saved notes in the same window. Finally, one click to save. 

It looks I miss something.. ohh.. yaaa.. I haven't named it!! Yes, because it isn't required, MyNote will do it for you. Yes, you heard right, it will name the note based on the first phrase of your note.
